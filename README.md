## About

To better understand how LASR is used in practice, Stefan Toth and Stefan Zörner conducted a small survey in November 2025.
It targeted people who were familiar with LASR and had already applied it to some extent.
Respondents were asked to provide information about a specific LASR review within their company or organization.
We distributed the survey to the LASR community via email and LinkedIn and received 57 responses within one week.

## Technical Approach

We conducted the survey using Google Forms, with both a German and an English version.
The questions were the same.
The raw data from the survey is available as CSV files in the *data* subdirectory.
We analyze it and share the results.
